  /- We can use {} to group a sequence of tactics in the
        tac ; [tac_1, ..., tac_n]
     notation.
     However, a {} will not force the goal to be completely solved.
     Example:
     The first constructor tactic will produce two goals.
     The `;` combinator will apply the tactics {trace "Case1: ", trace_state} to the first goal and
     constructor to the second.
  -/

lemma ex4 (a : nat) : a = a :=

  /- We can use tac;[] to make sure that tac did not produce any goal -/
