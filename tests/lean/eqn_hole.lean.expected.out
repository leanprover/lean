Possible solutions: 
  - Use 'using_well_founded' keyword in the end of your definition to specify tactics for synthesizing well founded relations and decreasing proofs.
  - The default decreasing tactic uses the 'assumption' tactic, thus hints (aka local proofs) can be provided using 'have'-expressions.
The nested exception contains the failure state for the decreasing tactic.
nested exception message:
failed
