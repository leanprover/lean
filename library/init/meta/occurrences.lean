/-  We can specify the scope of application of some tactics using
   the following type.

   - all : all occurrences of a given term are considered.

   - pos [1, 3] : only the first and third occurrences of a given
     term are consiered.

   - neg [2] : all but the second occurrence of a given term
     are considered. -/
