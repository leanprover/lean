Reducibility hints are used in the convertibility checker.
When trying to solve a constraint such a

           (f ...) =?= (g ...)

where f and g are definitions, the checker has to decide which one will be unfolded.
  If      f (g) is opaque,     then g (f) is unfolded if it is also not marked as opaque,
  Else if f (g) is abbrev,     then f (g) is unfolded if g (f) is also not marked as abbrev,
  Else if f and g are regular, then we unfold the one with the biggest definitional height.
  Otherwise both are unfolded.

The arguments of the `regular` constructor are: the definitional height and the flag `self_opt`.

The definitional height is by default computed by the kernel. It only takes into account
other regular definitions used in a definition. When creating declarations using meta-programming,
we can specify the definitional depth manually.

For definitions marked as regular, we also have a hint for constraints such as

          (f a) =?= (f b)

if self_opt == true, then checker will first try to solve (a =?= b), only if it fails,
it unfolds f.

Remark: the hint only affects performance. None of the hints prevent the kernel from unfolding a
declaration during type checking.

Remark: the reducibility_hints are not related to the attributes: reducible/irrelevance/semireducible.
These attributes are used by the elaborator. The reducibility_hints are used by the kernel (and elaborator).
Moreover, the reducibility_hints cannot be changed after a declaration is added to the kernel.
