/- TODO(Leo): remove meta as soon as equation compiler has support for well founded recursion.

   This is based on the minimalist Haskell "quicksort".

   Remark: this is *not* really quicksort since it doesn't partition the elements in-place -/
meta def qsort {α} (lt : α → α → bool) : list α → list α
| []     := []
| (h::t) :=
  let (large, small) := partition (λ x, lt h x = tt) t
  in qsort small ++ h :: qsort large

end list
