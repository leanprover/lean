A constructive proof of a non-standard version of the weak Fan Theorem
in the formulation of which infinite paths are treated as
predicates. The representation of paths as relations avoid the
need for classical logic and unique choice. The idea of the proof
comes from the proof of the weak König's lemma from separation in
second-order arithmetic:

-- inductively_barred P l means that P eventually holds above l

definition approx : (nat → Prop) → (list bool) → Prop

-- barred P means that for any infinite path represented as a predicate, the property P holds for some prefix of the path
definition barred P := ∀ X, ∃ l, approx X l ∧ P l

The proof proceeds by building a set Y of finite paths
approximating either the smallest unbarred infinite path in P, if
there is one (taking tt > ff), or the path tt::tt::...
if P happens to be inductively_barred
