  Replacing 2 by an arbitrary prime and the power 2 by any n ≥ 1 yields the stronger result
  that the nth root of an integer is irrational, unless the integer is already a perfect nth
  power.

  Thaetetus, who lives in the fourth century BC, is said to have proved the irrationality of square
  roots up to seventeen. In Chapter 4 of /Why Prove it Again/, John Dawson notes that Thaetetus may
  have used an approach similar to the one below. (See data/nat/gcd.lean for the key theorem,
  "div_gcd_eq_div_gcd".)
