=============

* [util](util.lean) : auxiliary facts about products
* [basic](basic.lean) : the constructive core of the quotient construction
* [classical](classical.lean) : the classical version, using Hilbert choice

These files provide an approach to defining quotients, without using
the built-in quotient types. They were initially used to define the
integers, but are no longer used there.
