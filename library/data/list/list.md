List of elements of a fixed type. By default, `import list` imports everything here.

[basic](basic.lean) : basic operations and properties
[comb](comb.lean) : combinators and list constructions
[set](set.lean) : set-like operations (these support the finset construction)
[perm](perm.lean) : equivalence up to permutation (these support the finset construction)
[as_type](as_type.lean) : treats a list as a type
