=========

The natural numbers. Note: all these files are ported from the standard library. If anything needs to be changed, it is probably a good idea to change it in the standard library and then port the file again (see also [script/port.pl](../../script/port.pl)).

* [basic](basic.hlean) : the natural numbers, with succ, pred, addition, and multiplication
* [order](order.hlean) : less-than, less-then-or-equal, etc.
* [sub](sub.hlean) : subtraction, and distance
