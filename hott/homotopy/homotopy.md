homotopy
========

Development of Homotopy Theory, including basic hits (higher inductive
types; see also [hit](../hit/hit.md)). The following files are in this
folder (sorted such that files only import previous files).

* [cylinder](cylinder.hlean) (Mapping cylinders, defined using quotients)
* [susp](susp.hlean) (Suspensions, defined using pushouts)
* [red_susp](red_susp.hlean) (Reduced suspensions)
* [sphere](sphere.hlean) (Higher spheres, defined recursively using suspensions)
* [circle](circle.hlean) (defined as sphere 1)
* [torus](torus.hlean) (defined as a two-quotient)
* [interval](interval.hlean) (defined as the suspension of unit)
* [cellcomplex](cellcomplex.hlean) (general cell complexes)
* [connectedness](connectedness.hlean)
* [cofiber](cofiber.hlean)
* [smash](smash.hlean)
