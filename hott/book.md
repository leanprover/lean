Things not in the book:

* One major difference is that in this library we heavily use pathovers, so we need less theorems about transports, but instead corresponding theorems about pathovers. These are in [init.pathover](init/pathover.hlean). For higher paths there are [squares](cubical/square.hlean), [squareovers](cubical/squareover.hlean), and the rudiments of [cubes](cubical/cube.hlean) and [cubeovers](cubical/cubeover.hlean).

Chapter 1: Type theory
---------

- 1.1 (Type theory versus set theory): no formalizable content.
- 1.2 (Function types): no formalizable content. Related: [init.function](init/function.hlean)
- 1.3 (Universes and families): no formalizable content (Lean also has a hierarchy of universes `Type.{i} : Type.{i + 1}`, but they are *not* cumulative).
- 1.4 (Dependent function types (Π-types)): no formalizable content. Related: [init.function](init/function.hlean)
- 1.5 (Product types): declaration in [init.datatypes](init/datatypes.hlean), notation in [init.types](init/types.hlean)

The rest is not formalized, and parts may be unformalizable because Lean lacks induction-induction
