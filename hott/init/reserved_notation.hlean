  Global declarations of right binding strength

  If a module reassigns these, it will be incompatible with other modules that adhere to these
  conventions.

  When hovering over a symbol, use "C-c C-k" to see how to input it.
-/

definition std.prec.max   : num := 1024 -- the strength of application, identifiers, (, [, etc.
definition std.prec.arrow : num := 25

/-
The next definition is "max + 10". It can be used e.g. for postfix operations that should
be stronger than application.
-/

definition std.prec.max_plus :=
num.succ (num.succ (num.succ (num.succ (num.succ (num.succ (num.succ (num.succ (num.succ
  (num.succ std.prec.max)))))))))
