=======================

* [limits](limits.hlean) : Limits in a category, defined as terminal object in the cone category
* [colimits](colimits.hlean) : Colimits in a category, defined as the limit of the opposite functor
* [functor_preserve](functor_preserve.hlean) : Functors which preserve limits and colimits
* [adjoint](adjoint.hlean) : the (co)limit functor is adjoint to the diagonal map
* [set](set.hlean) : set is a complete and cocomplete category
* [functor](functor.hlean) : if `D` has (co)limits of a certain shape, then so has `D ^ C`
